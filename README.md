# Fitness Tracker

When a person wants to develop the habit of exercising, it will be easier when there is a way to track progress. This application is designed to track your exercise and record the days and types of exercise performed. My task as a developer was to code the backend using MongoDB and upload it to Heroku. The application frontend was provided as startup code.

This application tracks your workout progress to keep and achieve any of your fitness goals. App users can view, track and/or create their workouts, as well as log the name and type of exercise and its details.
